Title: CSocketMaster - Winsock API implementation class
Description: CSocketMaster class is a winsock control substitute. It has the same interface and behavior winsock has so don't worry about having to learn how to use it. If you know how winsock works then you already know how CSocketMaster works. You can use a socket in a form, user control or class without external dependencies or huge memory leaking OCXs. Do you still prefer a user control? No hay problema! Check the samples and learn how ridiculous easy you can make a winsock control clone in less than 20 minutes (d@mn! I love encapsulation). Did I mention it's IDE safe? That's right, you can press the end button all you want and wont get a GPF. Take a look at the readme file for more info. This is my first post ever, please vote! This code is based on CSocket by Oleg Gdalevich that can be found on www.vbip.com (CSocket => CSocketMaster)
Keywords: socket, winsock, tcp, udp, internet, lan.
